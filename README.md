# EDA-Project
Practicum Sprint 7: Exploring and Cleaning Data with Pandas (Exploratory Data Analysis) Project

## To Do:
### Data Preprocessing
- [x] Load Datasets
- [x] Handle Column Names
- [x] Handle Duplicate Data
- [x] Handle Data Types
    - [x] make sure changing from `float`s to `int`s doesn't courrupt any data
- [x] Handle Missing Values

### Code
- [ ] Easy Part
    - [ ] Make sure `order_dow` and `order_hour_of_day` values make sense
    - [ ] Plot how many people place orders by `order_hour_of_day`
    - [ ] Plot how many people place orders by `order_dow`
    - [ ] Plot how many days pass between people placeing orders
    - [ ] Remark on findings
- [ ] Intermediate Part
    - [ ] Plot hour of day orders were placed on Saturdays and Wednesdays
    - [ ] Plot how many people place how many orders
    - [ ] Show `id` and `name` of top 20 Products by order frequency
    - [ ] Remark on findings
- [ ] Hard Part (two or more of these)
    - [ ] Plot distribution of how many items people have in each order
    - [ ] Show `id` and `name` of top 20 Products by re-order frequency
    - [ ] Plot what percentage of each product's orders are re-orders
    - [ ] Plot what percentage of each person's items ordered are re-orders
    - [ ] Show `id`, `name`, and frequency of top 20 Products people place in their carts first
    - [ ] Remark on findings
